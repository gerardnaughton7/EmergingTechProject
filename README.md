# Emerging Technology Project
## Overview for my Project
Overview for my project for Emerging Technology provide by our lecturer Ian McLoughlin:

In this project you will create a web application in Python to recognise digits in images. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, submit (or draw) an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image. You should use tensorflow and flask to do this. Note that accuracy of approximately 99% is considered excellent in recognising digits, so it is okay if your algorithm gets it wrong sometimes.

USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV FROM "file:///C:/TimeRoomRelationship.csv" AS row
MATCH (p1:Time {Name: toString(row[0])}), (p2:Room {Name: toString(row[1])})
CREATE (p2)-[:UseRoom]->(p1);
